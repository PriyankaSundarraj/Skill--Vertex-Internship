# Skill--Vertex-Internship
# Health Insurance Cost Prediction

This project is part of the final major internship at Skill Vertex. It involves predicting health insurance costs based on a dataset provided during the internship. The project encompasses data analysis, model building, visualization, and the creation of a prediction app.

## Dataset

- **Dataset**: health_insurance.csv
- **Dataset Description**: The dataset provided for this project contains information related to health insurance costs, including attributes such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis**: The dataset was thoroughly explored to gain insights into the features and their relationships. Visualization and statistical analysis were performed to understand the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps were undertaken, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

3. **Model Development**: Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated for the task of predicting health insurance costs. The models used include Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.

4. **Model Comparison**: The performance of each model was compared using evaluation metrics such as R-squared score. Observations and insights were recorded.

5. **Business Recommendations**: Based on the analysis and model results, recommendations were made on how businesses or the healthcare industry can benefit from the insights generated by this project.

6. **Dashboard and Prediction App**: A dashboard for data visualization and an interactive app for health insurance cost prediction were created using Streamlit.

## Submission Requirements

For the final project submission, the following components are required:

- **Report**: A comprehensive report (at least 15 pages) detailing the project's objectives, methodology, data analysis, model development, results, and recommendations.

- **Presentation**: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the key aspects of the project, including findings, model comparisons, and business recommendations.

- **Code File**: The Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing the code used for data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and visualization. The code should be well-structured, commented, and include markdown cells explaining the analysis.

- **Use of Multiple Models**: Multiple machine learning models should be used for the project, and their performance should be compared and analyzed.

- **Observations**: Detailed observations and insights should be included wherever data analysis or visualization is performed.

- **Business Recommendations**: Provide clear business recommendations based on the project's findings and insights.

- **Dashboard/App**: Create a data visualization dashboard or an app for health insurance cost prediction using Streamlit, as required by the project guidelines.

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app for health insurance cost prediction, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Streamlit app with the command: `streamlit run insurance_app.py`.
